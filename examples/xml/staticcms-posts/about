About
      </h>
<p>Staticcms is a very simple but flexible cms system.
It uses a repository of xml-files to generate output
using <em>XSLT</em> themes. So the <em>public</em>
cms is only static files. This makes it ideal for
servers which only serves static content and servers
with hight load.</p>

<section>
  <h>Structure</h>

  <p>The cms is really just a collection of xml-files. These
  files or <em>posts</em> have text-markup and zero-or-more
  <em>tags</em>.</p>

  <p>Tags are used to cateogorize posts. A post can be tagged
  with many tags, and many posts can share the same tag.</p>

  <h>Markup</h>

  <p>Staticcms uses the Enkel exml markup language. This is a simple
  markup language based on xhtml2.0, docbook and DITA markup. It supports
  the usual inline markup, tables, list, headings,
  hyperlinks and images.</p>
