<h>User tutorial - XML</h>

<p>We wish to be able to use only the characters available on the
keyboard to describe a layout similar to the one you are used to
from editors like <em>Microsoft Word</em> or <em>OpenOffice
Writer</em>. We want to be able to use <em>emphasized text</em>,
<strong>strongly emphasized text</strong>, tables, lists,
<a href="?">hyperlinks</a> and some other markup structures.</p>

<p>But we do not have a button on keyboard which creates a table or
a list. So we must use a markup language like <em>XML</em>.</p>

	<h>A simple XML example</h>
	<p>
		A part of the poem <em>348</em>
		by <em>Emily Dickinson</em> with some extra markup:
	<prog language="xml">
<![CDATA[<p>I dreaded that first Robin, so,
But <strong>He is mastered</strong>, now,
I'm some accustomed to Him grown,
He hurts a little, though-</p>

<p>I thought if I could only live
Till <em>that first Shout got by-</em>
Not all Pianos                   in the Woods
Had <a href="http://www.example.com">power</a> to

mangle me-</p>]]></prog>

		<p>I dreaded that first Robin, so,
		But <strong>He is mastered</strong>, now,
		I'm some accustomed to Him grown,
		He hurts a little, though-</p>

		<p>I thought if I could only live

		<h>Explaination</h>

		<p><em>XML</em> uses <strong>elements</strong> and plain text
		to give the plain text some meaning. A element:
			<ul>
				<li>Starts with &lt;<em>name of element</em>&gt;.</li>
				<li>Contains text and child elements.</li>
				<li>Ends with &lt;/<em>name of element</em>&gt;</li>
			</ul>

		General XML rules:
			<ul>
				<li>All whitespace between characters are interpeted
				as one <em>space</em>. Whitespace includes newline,
				tabs and normal spaces.</li>
				
				<li>You cannot use the characters <strong>&amp;</strong>,
				<strong>&lt;</strong> or <strong>&gt;</strong>
				unless you are writing a element. You must use the special
				characters described below.</li>
			</ul>

		So how do we end up with the nicely formatted result?
			<ul>
				<li>We say that the <strong>p</strong> element represents
				a paragraph. A paragraph is a block of text with
				vertical space above and below.</li>

				<li>The <strong>strong</strong> element represents
				bold (or strongly emphasized) text.</li>

				<li>The <strong>em</strong> element represents
				italic (or emphasized text).</li>

				<li>The <strong>a</strong> element represents a
				hyperlink.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>What is that <strong>href=</strong> in the start of the 
		<strong>a</strong> element?. That is called an attribute.
		Attributes are used when the name of the element does not
		describe its function well enough. Like a hyperlink, which
		would be useless without the actual hyperlink target.</p>

		<p>Sometimes you will use elements without any content. Only
		a name and some attributes like <strong>&lt;image
		href="myimage.jpg"&gt;&lt;/image&gt;</strong>. This can be
		shortened to <strong>&lt;image href="myimage.jpg"/&gt;</strong>.</p>
