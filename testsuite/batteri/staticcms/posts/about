		<h>About</h>
		<p>
			Staticcms is a very simple but flexible cms system.
			It uses a repository of xml-files to generate output
			using <em>XSLT</em> themes. So the <em>public</em>
			cms is only static files. This makes it ideal for
			servers which only serves static content and servers
			with hight load.

			<h>Structure</h>
			<p>
				The cms is really just a collection of xml-files. These
				files or <em>posts</em> have text-markup and zero-or-more
				<em>tags</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tags are used to cateogorize posts. A post can be tagged
				with many tags, and many posts can share the same tag.
			</p>

			<h>Markup</h>
			<p>
				StaticCms uses the Enkel markup language
				<strong>exml</strong>. This is a simple markup language
				based on xhtml2.0, docbook and DITA markup. It supports
				the usual inline markup, tables, list, headings,
				hyperlinks and images.
